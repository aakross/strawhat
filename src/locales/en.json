    "description": "Straw Hat was born from the shared dream of four travelers from Brazil and Mexico who found on the coast of Oaxaca a place where life should feel free and full of stories to tell. What began as a wild party hostel gradually evolved into a unique concept: a space where surfing, music, and nightlife blend with the calm of rest and the warmth of a community open to the world. Today, that spark has expanded beyond its origin, becoming three unforgettable places: Puerto Escondido, Tulum, and Mexico City. In each one, the plan is the same: live intensely, enjoy an epic night, and the next day wake up in a place perfect for relaxing and feeling part of something much bigger than a simple trip. Straw Hat is not just a hostel, it's an experience that embraces you, a home for free spirits seeking adventures, friends, and memories that last a lifetime."
